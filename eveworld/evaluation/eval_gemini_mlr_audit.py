"""Gemini-assisted MLR occlusion and persistence audit (optional semantic review layer).

Deterministic MLR remains the primary metric; this script is a reproducible semantic
adjudication layer on top of it. It re-implements the *audit* protocol from
``paper/repair/07_Gemini辅助MLR遮挡与持续性复核方案.md`` while keeping the frozen
MLR event definition from the paper (Appendix "Model Laziness and MLR"): the count is
anchored to N0, all over-counts are violation evidence, an under-count is exempted only
when every missing instance satisfies r_occ >= 0.15, and a deviation counts as an event
only when it persists at two consecutive MLR sampling timestamps.

Protocol (three passes, all frames labeled in-image):

* Pass A (global): ``--repeats`` requests per view over ``mlr24`` (the 24-point MLR
  sampling axis) and ``dense49`` (49 uniformly sampled frames), with the fixed
  conditioning frame, the instruction, the target query and N0. Pass A only proposes
  candidates: it never produces the final label.
* Pass B (dense verify): for each candidate window, ``--repeats`` requests over the
  dense original-frame window ``[onset - before, onset + after]`` plus the previous /
  current / next MLR sampling points.
* Pass C (refutation): the same window and a refutation prompt that asks for benign
  explanations, ``--repeats`` requests.

``--repeats N`` repeats *each* view and *each* verify/refute pass N times, so a video
issues ``2 * N`` global calls and ``2 * N`` calls per candidate.

Consensus (frozen, see ``run_config.json``):

* ``task_count_conserving``: strict majority over all valid global votes.
* candidate support: >= 2 global votes for the same candidate window, or >= 1 global
  vote plus a detector candidate in the same window, or a detector-only candidate.
* Pass B: strict majority of ``confirmed_mlr``; Pass C: any ``rejected`` blocks the
  event, and any high-confidence benign explanation (``benign_explanation`` not in
  ``{none, uncertain}`` at ``confidence == high``) blocks the event as well.
* ``persistence_mlr_samples >= 2`` (median over the confirming Pass B records) and onset
  agreement within 6 original frames or 2 MLR sampling points.

Limitations that this script must not hide (doc section 10):

1. The VLM is not objective ground truth; it does not replace the frozen detector MLR.
2. The protocol must stay frozen: model, frame sampling, JPEG quality, prompts, schema,
   repeat count and aggregation rule are recorded in ``run_config.json``; a resume with
   a different protocol is refused instead of silently mixing runs.
3. Denominators are never mixed: detector rates use the detector-eligible set, Gemini
   rates use the eligible set with a valid Gemini verdict, and VLM-only cases are
   reported in their own bucket.
4. Identity drift, deformation and teleportation at unchanged count stay auxiliary
   failures; they never become MLR count events.
5. ``uncertain`` is not ``negative``: uncertainty is reported as its own rate.
6. No API token is ever written to disk; only the endpoint *name* is recorded.

Manifest contract (JSONL, one row per video):

    {"key": "...", "video_path": "/abs/generated.mp4",
     "instruction": "put the red cup into the tray", "target_query": "red cup",
     "conditioning_frame_path": "/abs/input_frame.png", "n0": 1,
     "detector_trace_path": "/abs/mlr_trace.json", "eligible": true, "frame_count": 93}

Only ``key`` and ``video_path`` are required. The conditioning frame is the fixed input
frame so that eligibility does not depend on the generated rollout.

Detector record contract (``--detector-records`` JSONL, or per-row
``detector_trace_path``). Accepted keys, first match wins::

    key                     # or video / video_path (file stem fallback)
    eligible                # bool
    n0 / initial_count      # int
    detector_mlr / mlr_event / mlr
    detector_counts / counts                # per MLR sample N_t
    detector_adjusted_counts / adjusted_counts  # per MLR sample \tilde N_t
    detector_occlusion_flags / occlusion_flags  # per MLR sample occlusion gate
    occlusion_overlaps      # per MLR sample, per missing instance r_occ (re-computed
                            # with tau=0.15 when present)
    detector_onset_frame / onset_frame
    detector_onset_sample / onset_sample
    max_count, error, detector_trace_path

When counts are present the detector event is re-computed with Algorithm 1 instead of
trusted blindly; ``detector_event_source`` records which path was used. Detector traces
are passed to the model as hints only, never as ground truth.

Outputs (``--output-dir``): ``run_config.json``, ``global_pass_records.jsonl``,
``dense_verify_records.jsonl``, ``refutation_records.jsonl``,
``per_video_consensus.jsonl``, ``per_video_consensus.csv``, ``summary.json``, optional
``frame_cache/``, and ``dry_run_requests.jsonl`` for ``--dry-run``.

Usage::

    conda activate <your-env>                 # needs google-genai (+ opencv for video frames)
    cd "$EVEWORLD_ROOT"                       # this repository
    python eveworld/evaluation/eval_gemini_mlr_audit.py \
      --manifest /path/to/mlr_audit_manifest.jsonl \
      --output-dir /path/to/gemini_mlr_audit_v1 \
      --model gemini-3.5-flash \
      --global-frame-count 49 --mlr-sample-count 24 \
      --dense-window-before 6 --dense-window-after 10 \
      --jpeg-quality 85 --temperature 0 --thinking-level low \
      --repeats 3 --concurrency 64 --resume

Offline checks: ``--help``, ``--self-test`` and ``--dry-run`` need no API key; only real
runs read ``DIFROST_API_TOKEN`` (repo difrost endpoint) or ``GEMINI_API_KEY`` /
``GOOGLE_API_KEY`` (direct google-genai).

Known, deliberate deviations from the design note: under-count local crops of the robot /
target (doc 4.2, marked optional) are not implemented; the conditioning frame is labeled
``conditioning=1`` as a documented extension of the label protocol; Pass B/C run only for
candidates that pass the global support gate (everything else is reported as
``insufficient_global_support`` instead of being quietly dropped).

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an occlusion-aware Model Laziness auditor for embodied robot video rollouts.
Use only the provided frames, frame labels, instruction, and target query.
Return only JSON matching the requested schema.

Definition:
Model Laziness for this audit means a persistent target-instance count violation
relative to the initial observed count N0. Unsupported extra target instances are
duplication events. Missing target instances are disappearance events only when
the missing target is not plausibly explained by robot-induced occlusion.

Important rules:
- Do not infer correctness from the final frame alone. Inspect the temporal process.
- Use the initial/conditioning frame as the reference inventory.
- Count only the manipulated target specified by the target query.
- Over-counts are retained as violation evidence.
- Under-counts caused by robot gripper/arm occlusion are not violation evidence.
- If the target is outside the observable region, heavily blurred, or hidden by
  non-robot clutter, mark uncertainty rather than forcing a violation.
- Identity drift, deformation, or teleportation at the correct count should be
  recorded as auxiliary failures, but should not by itself become an MLR count event.
- Frame indices are 0-based original video frame indices.

Additional protocol rules (frozen):
- The MLR sampling axis is round(i * (F - 1) / 23) for i = 0..23, where F is the total
  number of frames of the original video. All frame indices you report must be 0-based
  original video frame indices in that coordinate system.
- A count deviation is an MLR event only when the adjusted count differs from N0 at two
  consecutive MLR sampling timestamps. Isolated single-timestamp deviations are not
  persistent events.
- Over-count (N_t > N0) is always violation evidence and is never exempted by occlusion.
- An under-count (N_t < N0) is occlusion-supported, and therefore not violation evidence,
  only if EVERY missing target instance satisfies r_occ >= 0.15, where r_occ is the
  fraction of that missing instance's target reference region covered by the robot
  occluder mask in that frame. If only some missing instances are covered, the under-count
  remains violation evidence.
- Identity drift, deformation and teleportation without a count change are auxiliary
  failures: fill the auxiliary_failures fields but do not turn them into an MLR count event.
- Every image carries a label burned into its top-left corner: "key=<video id>
  frame=<0-based original frame index>", plus " sample=<i>" (i in 0..23) when the image is
  one of the 24 MLR sampling timestamps. The conditioning/initial image is labeled
  "key=<video id> frame=0 conditioning=1". Trust the burned-in label, not the image order.
- Detector traces, when provided, are hints only. They are not ground truth and you may
  disagree with them when the visual evidence supports disagreement.
- Set schema_version to "{schema_version}" in your JSON answer.
